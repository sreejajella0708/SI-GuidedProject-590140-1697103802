Therefore, the training methods of coaches for powerlifters are extremely important, and studying the factors that influence athletes' performance is an inseparable task in training process. based on the data powerlifting data in the international competitions; they calculated the score of powerlifters at their peak performance, thereby giving the development trend of athletes, helping experts to evaluate more correctly about the athletes' abilities before playing. 

To address these, regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision tree, Random forest, and XgBoost will be used. We will train and test the data with these algorithms. From this the best model is selected and saved in pkl format. We will also be deploying our model locally using Flask.
